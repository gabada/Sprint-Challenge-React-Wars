1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?


React JS is a JavaScript library built by Facebook, it is used for building user interfaces and front-end applications. The problem it tries to solve is how to deal with complex state without sacrificing performance with DOM operations/manipulation. One example is the to do list we built. React makes it possible to add an item to the todo list but ONLY render that item, instead of re-rendering the entire page or list and adding the new item in. React is highly scalable so when you have a site like Facebook only rendering the changes to the DOM help a lot with performance.
